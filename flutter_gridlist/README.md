# flutter News app listView with clean architecture

Flutter project with clean architecture for practice purposes 

## Clean architecture

This project uses clean architecture based on Reso Coder 7 hour tutorial

I create this example to practice and also as a way to fully conprehend all the paradigms and practices that are involved in a flutter app developed with clean architecture.

Important libraries:

- Flutter bloc to manage state
- get_it (dependency injection)
- dartz to return to different types from methods
- Equatable to make comparisons easier


Simple UI design to present recent news depending on the country the user select.
